== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is password data stored or transmitted? =

No. All password analysis is performed entirely on the user's device using JavaScript. The only exception is the optional breach database check, which uses a secure k-anonymity model that only sends the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 hash to the HaveIBeenPwned API, ensuring your actual password is never transmitted.

= How does the breach database check work? =

We integrate with the HaveIBeenPwned API using their privacy-preserving k-anonymity model. When checking if a password has been compromised, we:
1. Generate a SHA-1 hash of the password locally
2. Send only the first 5 characters of the hash to the API
3. Receive a list of hash suffixes that match the prefix
4. Compare locally to determine if there's a match
This ensures your actual password never leaves your device.

= Can I customize the appearance and functionality? =

Yes! The plugin offers extensive customization options:
* Light and dark themes built-in
* Customizable colors using CSS custom properties
* Shortcode parameters for different display modes
* WordPress hooks and filters for advanced customization

= Can I disable certain features? =

Yes, you have complete control over features through shortcode parameters:
* `show_education="false"` - Hide educational content
* `show_leads="false"` - Disable lead capture forms
* `mode="quick"` - Show simplified interface
* `theme="dark"` - Switch to dark theme
* Custom CSS can hide or modify any elements

= Is it translation ready? =

The current version includes English text only, but the plugin architecture supports internationalization. Translation files can be added for different languages, and the plugin follows WordPress translation best practices.

= How accurate is the strength analysis? =

Our algorithm uses industry-standard calculations including:
* Shannon entropy for mathematical complexity assessment
* NIST 800-63B guidelines for compliance checking
* Real-world attack modeling for time-to-crack estimates
